Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Solution: 两端逼近，一端大于另一端时，剩下的一列就没必要比了

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int len = height.length;
        int max = 0;
        int lo= 0,hi = len-1;
        while(lo<hi){
            max = Math.max(max,Math.min(height[lo],height[hi])*(hi-lo));
            if(height[lo]<height[hi]) 
                lo++;
            else
                hi--;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
