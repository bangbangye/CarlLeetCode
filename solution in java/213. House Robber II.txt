Note: This is an extension of House Robber.

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Solution:

public class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        if(nums.length==1) return nums[0];
        return Math.max(robS(nums,0,nums.length-2),robS(nums,1,nums.length-1));
        
    }
    
    public int robS(int[] nums,int s,int e){
        int inc = 0;
        int exc = 0;
        for(int i=s;i<=e;i++){
            int ti = inc,te = exc;
            inc = nums[i]+exc;
            exc = Math.max(ti,te);
        }
        return Math.max(inc,exc);
    }
}
